With the ability to run on any web-enabled device, including mobile phones, VR headsets, and personal computers, this augmented reality tech demo focuses on maximizing patient accessibility. The app works by adapting to different camera streams to create a dynamic, blue projection of various rehabilitative exercises. Patients only need to hold our their arm out and follow along.

In addition to guiding patients through rehabilitative exercises, the AR application displays live feedback on the accuracy of performed exercises; feedback and footage can optionally be sent to a patientâ€™s physical therapist for review. Through maximizing the accuracy of performed exercises, our goal is to increase efficacy of rehabilitation, and by extension, the overall recovery rate of our patients.
