With the ability to run on any web-enabled device, including mobile phones, VR headsets, and personal computers, this augmented reality tech demo focuses on maximizing patient accessibility. The app works by adapting to different camera streams to create a dynamic, blue projection of various rehabilitative exercises. Patients only need to hold our their arm out and follow along.
